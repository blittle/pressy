I'm trying to setup automatic deploys to github pages of the flatland example. It has two requirements:
1. Merging to main, deploys to github pages
2. An open PR, should also deploy to github pages, but in a directory scoped to the PR
3. When the PR is closed, the scoped directory on github pages should get removed

---

Now I see it's running the GH action, but I see this error: `Error: Unable to resolve action rossjrw/pr-preview-deploy-action, repository not found`

---

Now I see this error in the action workflow:
```
  Error: Multiple versions of pnpm specified:
    - version 9 in the GitHub Action config with the key "version"
    - version pnpm@8.12.0 in the package.json with the key "packageManager"
  Remove one of these versions to avoid version mismatch errors like ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION

What's causing this error when running `pnpm build`:
```

Should line 37 of @.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml just do a `pnpm build`, so it's using the same script as me when I test?

---

I don't think that line 42 of @.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml is the right command to build the example

---

Running that command gives this error:
```
 pnpm --filter flatland-example build                                                                              1 ↵

But this also needs to be done in the gh action script?
