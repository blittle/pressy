### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Book Cover Image on Home Page

## Context

The home/landing page (`renderBookPage()` in `client.tsx`) currently shows only the book title, author, description, and chapter list. The user wants a prominent cover image displayed on this page. Cover images already exist in the content (e.g., `examples/flatland/content/books/flatland/cover.svg`) and `_book.yaml` references them (`cover: cover.svg`), but the cover discovery in `plugin.ts` only checks for `.jpg`/`.png`...

### Prompt 2

The layout of the home page is fine, but it just feels a bit boring. How could we make it more exciting or engaging given the content on it?
