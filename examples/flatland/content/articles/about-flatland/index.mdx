# About This Digital Edition

This digital edition of *Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions* by Edwin A. Abbott has been prepared from the public domain text available through Project Gutenberg. The text has been lightly adapted for presentation as a modern web publication using the Pressy framework.

*Flatland* was first published in 1884 and is in the public domain. This edition is based on the second revised edition, also published in 1884, which included a new preface by the author.

## About the Original Work

Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926) was an English schoolmaster, theologian, and author. He served as headmaster of the City of London School from 1865 to 1889, where he was known as a progressive educator who championed the education of women and the working classes.

*Flatland* was published under the pseudonym "A Square" and tells the story of a two-dimensional being who discovers the existence of a third dimension. The novella operates on multiple levels: as a mathematical thought experiment about dimensions, as a satire of Victorian social hierarchy, and as a spiritual allegory about the limits of perception.

## Editorial Choices

The text has been divided into chapters following Abbott's original structure. Annotations have been added throughout in the form of asides and footnotes to provide historical context and to highlight Abbott's satirical intent, which may not be immediately apparent to modern readers.

Some passages, particularly those concerning the treatment of women in Flatland society, require careful contextual reading. Abbott's depictions are deliberately exaggerated to expose the absurdity of Victorian attitudes toward women — not to endorse them.

We hope this edition brings new readers to Abbott's remarkable little book, and that the interactive format helps illuminate its many layers of meaning.
