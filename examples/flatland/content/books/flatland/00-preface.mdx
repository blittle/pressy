# Preface to the Second and Revised Edition

If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to represent him in this preface, in which he desires, firstly, to return his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation has, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work; secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which, however, he is not entirely responsible); and thirdly, to explain one or two misconceptions.

But he is not the Square he once was. Years of imprisonment, and the continued consciousness that he is regarded by the world as a madman, have taken their toll. His mind is not what it was.

<Aside title="Historical Note">
This preface was added to the second edition, published in 1884, just months after the first edition.
</Aside>

To the former objection I would reply that I do not, of course, imagine that Flatlanders could possibly be able to see anything in Spaceland. I meant merely to describe the actual facts; namely, that the Eye of the Square really did see that which he describes, just as our eyes, though they cannot perceive the Third Dimension, do perceive shadows and perspectives which imply its existence.

To the critics who ask whether the Third Dimension can have any existence, I reply: Are you not yourselves the inhabitants of that Dimension? Move your eye upward or downward. Can you do that in Flatland?
