title: Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland
---

As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass — North, South, East, and West.

There being no sun nor heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our own. By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight — so that even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs northward without much difficulty — yet the hampering effect of the southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts of our earth.

<Footnote id="1">
  Abbott's "attraction to the South" is an analogy to gravity. In Flatland, this
  constant force serves the same navigational purpose that gravity and celestial
  bodies serve in our three-dimensional world.

Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North. In the country, where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some guide. Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be expected in determining our bearings.

Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the weights of the bodies of the inhabitants are considerable, the southward attraction has an immense effect on their physical life.

The most common form of house in the temperate regions is a Pentagon, having on the Southern side a small door for the Women, and a larger one on the Northern side for the Men. Square and Triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The angles of a Square (and still more so those of an equilateral Triangle) being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running against them.

<Footnote id="2">
  The architecture of Flatland is dictated entirely by safety concerns. Since
  inhabitants cannot perceive depth and move freely across the plane, sharp
  angles on buildings pose a genuine hazard — one might accidentally impale
  oneself on the corner of a house.

Therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other state buildings, which it is not desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection.
