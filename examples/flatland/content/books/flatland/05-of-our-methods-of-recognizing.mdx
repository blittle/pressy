title: Of Our Methods of Recognizing One Another
---

You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually SEE an angle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the happy region of the Three Dimensions — how shall I make clear to you the extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing one another's configuration?

Recall what I told you above. All beings in Flatland, animate or inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same, or nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line. How then can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?

<Footnote id="4">
  This chapter addresses one of the most fundamental philosophical questions
  raised by Flatland: how does perception shape reality? The Flatlanders'
  inability to directly perceive shape mirrors our own inability to perceive
  higher dimensions. Just as they must rely on indirect methods to understand
  their two-dimensional world, we too rely on inference and mathematics to
  conceptualize dimensions beyond our own.
</Footnote>

The answer is threefold. The first means of recognition is the sense of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you, and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice our personal friends, but even to discriminate between different classes, at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral, the Square, and the Pentagon.

The second method is that of Feeling, or, as our learned men prefer to call it, the Art of Sight Recognition, which I will now endeavour to explain.

<Aside title="Feeling vs. Sight">
  In Flatland, "Feeling" is the common method of recognition among the lower and
  middle classes. It involves physically tracing the outline of another person
  to determine their shape and therefore their social class. This practice,
  while considered vulgar by the upper classes, is the most reliable method
  available to ordinary Flatlanders.
</Aside>

You, in your wisdom, are accustomed to regard Feeling as an inferior method of recognition, to be tolerated only among the lowest of your Creatures. In Flatland it is different: there, Feeling is the acknowledged superior of Hearing, as providing more reliable evidence.

The practice of Feeling is fraught with a certain degree of danger. "How do you do, sir? I am a Pentagon." This is the usual formula of recognition between two of the middle classes; the person addressed thereupon extends his right hand, and feels the angle, carefully noting the exact measurement.

<Footnote id="5">
  The "Feeling" method of recognition carries real social weight in Flatland.
  Refusing to allow oneself to be "felt" is considered a grievous insult, while
  claiming to have more sides than one actually possesses is a criminal offence
  punishable by death.
</Footnote>

But among the higher classes this tedious process of Feeling is not resorted to, and the superior method of Sight Recognition is adopted. I will now endeavour to explain this method.
