# Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland

## Part II: Other Worlds

<Callout type="important" title="A New Dimension">
With this chapter begins the second part of A Square's memoir. Having described the world of Flatland in detail, our narrator now recounts the extraordinary events that shattered his understanding of reality — an encounter with a being from the Third Dimension.

From dreams I proceed to facts.

It was the last day of the 1999th year of our era. The pattering of the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting in the company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the prospects of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.

My four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their several apartments; and my wife alone remained with me to see the old Millennium out and the new one in.

I was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had casually issued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity.

<Aside title="The Millennium">
Abbott sets this pivotal scene at the turn of a millennium — a time of transition and upheaval. This is no accident: the revelation of new dimensions is framed as an epochal event, as significant to A Square's worldview as the turn of an era.

His words were these: "Grandpa, suppose I were to see a Line from the inside — not from the outside, but from within — should I not then perceive its interior, its very being?"

I had been occupied in musing on the rudimentary and ill-regulated ideas of Irregular Figures. I replied that he should not trouble himself with such idle fancies, which led nowhere and were contrary to the teachings of our Elders.

At that moment there arose a strange sound — like the rushing of mighty waters — and presently a Voice broke in upon our silence.

"What is this?" said my wife. "There is no one in the room but ourselves."

I looked, and there, in the direction from which the Voice had come, I perceived a Figure — and such a Figure as I had never in my life beheld.

<Aside title="The Sphere Arrives">
The stranger is, of course, a Sphere — a three-dimensional being who appears to A Square as a circle of varying size, depending on which cross-section of the Sphere intersects the plane of Flatland. This encounter forms the dramatic and philosophical heart of Abbott's novella.

"Hush," said I to my wife, "there is something extraordinary here."

The Figure was not a Point, nor a Line, nor any shape I had ever seen, but a Circle — yet not a Circle: for the edges were not constant, but seemed to breathe, to expand, and to contract. A Circle that could change its size at will — this was something utterly foreign to all my experience.

"How can it be a Circle," I murmured, "and yet change its magnitude?"

The stranger spoke again: "I am not a Circle. I am what you would call a visitor from the Third Dimension."
