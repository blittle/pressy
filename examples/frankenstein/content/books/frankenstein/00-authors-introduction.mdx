# Author's Introduction

The publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting "Frankenstein" for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so very frequently asked me — "How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?"

<Callout type="note" title="The 1831 Introduction">
  This introduction was written by Mary Shelley for the revised third edition of
  1831, thirteen years after the novel's original publication. It provides a
  fascinating account of how the story came to be written during the famous
  summer of 1816 at the Villa Diodati.

It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing. As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given me for recreation, was to "write stories." Still I had a dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of castles in the air — the indulging in waking dreams — the following up trains of thought, which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents.

My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close imitator — rather doing as others had done, than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for one other eye — my childhood's companion and friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed — my dearest pleasure when free.

<Aside title="The Villa Diodati">
  In the summer of 1816, Mary Godwin (not yet married to Percy Shelley) travelled
  to Lake Geneva with Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, John Polidori, and Claire
  Clairmont. Confined indoors by incessant rain, Byron proposed that each member
  of the party write a ghost story — a challenge that would produce both
  *Frankenstein* and Polidori's *The Vampyre*.
</Aside>

I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy.

Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and communicated.

Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.

<Footnote id="1">
  Galvanism refers to experiments conducted by Luigi Galvani in the 1780s,
  in which he applied electrical current to the muscles of dead frogs, causing
  them to twitch. These experiments captured the public imagination and raised
  questions about the relationship between electricity and life.

Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by, before we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw — with shut eyes, but acute mental vision — I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.

Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.
