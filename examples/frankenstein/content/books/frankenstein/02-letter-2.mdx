# Letter 2

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

Archangel, 28th March, 17—

How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged, appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.

But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.

<Aside title="Walton's Loneliness">
  Walton's yearning for a companion who can understand his intellectual
  passions directly foreshadows Victor Frankenstein's isolation and, more
  poignantly, the creature's desperate longing for companionship. This theme
  of loneliness and the need for connection runs through every layer of the novel.
</Aside>

I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!

I well remember the last time you permitted me to see you. You said something of your desire to travel. And I should be delighted if the sight of foreign lands and manners should supply the deficiency of my own previous experience. I have one secret, Margaret, which I have never yet communicated to you; perhaps you might be surprised, perhaps amused, when I should disclose it. Prepare yourself for something wonderful.

<Footnote id="1">
  Walton's admission of having a "secret" creates a parallel with Victor
  Frankenstein, whose own secret — the creation of the creature — will consume
  and ultimately destroy him. Shelley constructs these parallels deliberately.
</Footnote>

I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.

<SceneBreak variant="line" />

Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.

But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.

Your affectionate brother,
R. Walton
