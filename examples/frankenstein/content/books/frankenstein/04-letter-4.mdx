# Letter 4

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

August 5th, 17—

So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.

Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

<Callout type="important" title="The Encounter">
  This letter marks the pivotal moment of the frame narrative: Walton's crew
  encounters a mysterious figure on the ice, followed by the arrival of Victor
  Frankenstein himself. From this point, the novel shifts from Walton's voice
  to Victor's own account of his extraordinary and terrible history.
</Callout>

About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our minds from our own situation.

We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.

<Aside title="The Creature Glimpsed">
  This fleeting vision of a gigantic figure on a dog-sledge is the reader's first
  encounter with Frankenstein's creature, seen from a great distance and through
  a veil of Arctic mist. The figure is not yet identified — but for readers who
  know the story, this moment is charged with recognition and dread.
</Aside>

In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European.

When I appeared on deck, the master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."

On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. "Before I come on board your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"

<SceneBreak variant="asterisks" />

You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a most welcome asylum. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.

Upon hearing this, he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.

<Footnote id="1">
  Victor's first concern — the direction of the vessel — reveals that even in
  his desperate state, he is still pursuing the creature. His obsession has not
  dimmed even at the threshold of death. This single question encapsulates the
  novel's central tragedy.

When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."

"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"

"Yes."
