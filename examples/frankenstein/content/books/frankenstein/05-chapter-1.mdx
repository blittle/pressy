# Chapter 1

I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.

<Callout type="note" title="Victor's Narrative Begins">
  From this point, the novel shifts to Victor Frankenstein's own voice as he
  tells his story to Captain Walton. This creates the novel's distinctive
  nested structure: Walton's letters contain Victor's narrative, which will
  in turn contain the creature's own account.
</Callout>

He was deeply attached to the duties of his station, and held himself bound to dedicate the remainder of his life, when he had performed those duties, to the instruction of his children. He had several children, of whom I was the eldest, and from my earliest years I was the constant companion of my mother, and the favourite of my father. The love they had bestowed upon each other was, if possible, even more extraordinary than their attachment to myself.

My father was not young when he married, and my mother was not yet old when she died. But what I describe is a picture of domestic happiness that no subsequent misfortune has been able to dim.

<Aside title="The Shelley Connection">
  Victor's idealized childhood in Geneva draws on Mary Shelley's own complicated
  relationship with family. Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, died shortly after
  her birth, and her relationship with her father, William Godwin, was strained.
  The loving domestic scenes here represent a paradise that Victor will destroy
  through his ambition.
</Aside>

My mother's tender caresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better — their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.

With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.

<Footnote id="1">
  The language of parental duty here — "the being to which they had given life" —
  foreshadows and contrasts bitterly with Victor's abandonment of the creature
  he brings into existence. Where Victor's parents accepted their obligations,
  Victor himself will flee from his.
</Footnote>

For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.

<SceneBreak variant="line" />

Among the Italian poor it was then not uncommon to find families whose children were maintained and brought up by strangers. My parents had gone one day to visit a poor family, and among the children found a very beautiful child, with fair hair and blue eyes. This child was Elizabeth Lavenza.

My mother, who had noticed this child with fond admiration, found, upon inquiry, that she was the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, who had been placed in the care of a poor family by her father, who was now dead.

When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub — a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.

Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening before she was brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, "I have a pretty present for my Victor — to-morrow he shall have it." And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine — mine to protect, love, and cherish.
