# Chapter 2

We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst of knowledge.

She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home — the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers — she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.

<Aside title="Two Ways of Knowing">
  Shelley draws a deliberate contrast between Elizabeth's contemplative,
  aesthetic relationship with nature and Victor's restless desire to uncover
  its secrets. This distinction is central to the novel's themes: Victor's
  determination to penetrate nature's mysteries — rather than simply appreciate
  them — leads directly to the catastrophe that follows.
</Aside>

The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.

On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on the shores of the lake, at Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake.

It was here that the events occurred which determined my future destiny.

<SceneBreak variant="asterisks" />

When I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Fatal Discovery">
  Victor's chance discovery of Cornelius Agrippa — a 16th-century occult
  philosopher and alchemist — is the pivotal moment of his intellectual
  development. His father's dismissal of the book ("my dear Victor, do not waste
  your time upon this; it is sad trash") only inflames his curiosity. Had his
  father explained *why* Agrippa's theories were discredited, Victor's path
  might have been entirely different.
</Callout>

A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book, and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."

If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and have contented my imagination by returning to my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.

<Footnote id="1">
  Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) was a German polymath, physician, and occult
  writer. His major work, *De Occulta Philosophia*, attempted to reconcile
  natural magic with Christian theology. By Shelley's time, his ideas had long
  been superseded by modern chemistry and physics.
</Footnote>

But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself.

I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy's apprehensions, as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
