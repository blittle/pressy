# Chapter 3

When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.

My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred — an omen, as it were, of my future misery.

<Callout type="warning" title="Death Enters">
  The death of Victor's mother marks the end of his Edenic childhood and sets
  in motion the chain of events that will define the novel. Her death from
  scarlet fever — contracted while nursing Elizabeth — introduces the theme
  of death as something that might be overcome, planting the seed that will
  grow into Victor's terrible ambition.
</Callout>

Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sick bed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper — Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.

On the third day my mother sickened; the fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: "My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children."

<Aside title="The Mother's Legacy">
  Caroline Frankenstein's deathbed wish — that Victor and Elizabeth should marry —
  becomes a thread of fate running through the novel. Her death also establishes
  a pattern that Victor will unconsciously repeat: the attempt to conquer death
  through the application of devoted will, with catastrophic results.
</Aside>

She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil; the void that presents itself to the soul; and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for ever — that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to be heard.

<SceneBreak variant="ornament" />

My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. They were spent in melancholy consideration and in mourning. At length I tore myself from all that was dear, and set out for the university.

I had hitherto been accustomed to the gentle manners of the Swiss; and the rougher customs that prevailed among the inhabitants of the place where I was now to reside gave me a sensation of strangeness. I repaired to the university with the greatest diligence, and presented myself to the several professors.

M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy, was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the professor did not prepossess me in his favour. "Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"

I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost."

<Footnote id="1">
  The University of Ingolstadt was a real institution in Bavaria, founded in
  1472. By the time Shelley was writing, it had been relocated to Landshut
  (1800) and then to Munich (1826), where it became Ludwig Maximilian University.
  Shelley chose it for its association with both scientific advancement and,
  notably, as the birthplace of the Illuminati.

But M. Waldman — ah, M. Waldman! He was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.

"The ancient teachers of this science," said he, "promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles."

Such were the professor's words — rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to destroy me.
