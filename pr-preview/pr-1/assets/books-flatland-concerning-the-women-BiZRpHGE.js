Just so is it with one of our Women. When her side is fully turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end containing her eye or mouth — for with us these two organs are identical — is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a highly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to us, then — Loss of sight, and sometimes of life, is the penalty for coming too near."}),`
