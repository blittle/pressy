`,e(t.p,{children:"If there were no Fog, all lines would appear equally and indistinguishably clear, and this is actually the case in those unhappy countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and transparent. But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog, objects that are at a distance, say of three feet, are appreciably dimmer than those at a distance of two feet eleven inches; and the result is that by careful and constant experimental observation of comparative dimness and clearness, we are enabled to infer with great exactness the configuration of the object observed."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"An Equilateral Triangle, for example, when I am close to the middle of one of its sides, appears to me in Fog as a straight line. But if I move to either end of the line, the middle point, being nearer to me, appears brighter, while the two ends, being farther away, are dimmer. The line therefore appears to graduate smoothly from bright in the centre to dim at the extremities."}),`

As you move along the side, the apparent brightness of the nearer portions increases, while the more distant portions grow dimmer."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"It is this variation of brightness, this gentle gradation from light to shadow, that enables us to distinguish one figure from another.

The more sides a figure possesses, the more gradual and uniform the brightness variation appears."}),`
